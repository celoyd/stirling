In no particular order, and not all necessarily a good idea.

1. Separate out all configuration.

Blog title, e-mail address, etc. Possibly also do a more baseline CSS.


2. Pagination and permalinking.

Possibly generate serial numbers for links. Time with microseconds may be a bad idea for primary key. Implausible as it is, it's not impossible for htere to be a collision on multiuser stuff.


3. Consider multiuser. Fix security.


4. Tags? Keep database normalized.


5. /mod/ -- rename, add text fields, etc.


6. Make everything localiz(able|ed).


7. Prettify database schema (e.g. fix my stupid column names). Consider MySQL/sqlite/couchdb etc. compat.
